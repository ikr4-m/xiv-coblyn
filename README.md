## Translator Provider
Currently, we're using [LibreTranslate](https://github.com/LibreTranslate/LibreTranslate) that using [Argos Translate](https://github.com/argosopentech/argos-translate) as an engine for translate. Thank you for Argos Open Corp to host a very-very great Open Source translate.

We'll see if the project is too good enough for next round, we'll self host the LibreTranslate to make sure the plugin is stable and doesn't burden a lot of traffic to Argos.

## How to Use
